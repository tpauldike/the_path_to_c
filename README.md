# The Path to `C`
The path to `C` is the renowned [*Journey through C*](https://github.com/tpauldike/journey_through_C) series reloaded.
This series is about teaching `C programming` from the scratch in recorded Peer Learning Sessions with [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), in a way that is easier for fellow students of ALX SE (who are serious indeed) to understand.

The codes here are written in the live sessions which do not have a particular time schedule. But you can stay up to date and participate live by joining this [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FmMxUlVfbAvJf7XXUbCAwi)

The essence of saving the codes and video recordings is to keep something that anyone learning `C programming` in ALX SE and beyond can refer to, at any moment in time.

The video recordings are available on [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU10dryLOLEFp598xm9eH1nn_DRN7S5mt).
